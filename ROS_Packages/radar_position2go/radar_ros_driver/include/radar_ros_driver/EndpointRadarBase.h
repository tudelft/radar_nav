/**
 * \file EndpointRadarBase.h
 *
 * \brief This file defines the API to communicate with Radar Base Endpoints
 *        in Infineon sensor devices.
 *
 * The module EndpointRadarBase.c provides functions to communicate with
 * Infineon radar sensor devices. The user must use the function provided by
 * the module \ref Protocol.c to open a connection to a radar sensor device
 * and query information about the endpoints in the device.
 *
 * The function \ref ep_radar_base_is_compatible_endpoint can be used to check
 * each endpoint if it is compatible with this API. If it is the types and
 * functions in from this module can be used to send parameters to the
 * endpoint and query the current settings and radar frame data.
 *
 * All data received from the connected device is returned through callbacks.
 * For each message type that can be received from the device, a separate
 * callback function type is defined. The user must register the callback
 * function for each message type. If no callback function is registered the
 * received message is ignored. Additionally the user can provide a data
 * context pointer for each callback function that will be forwarded with any
 * call to that function.

/**
 * \brief This enumeration type lists the possible formats of sampled radar
 *        data.
 *
 * The format of sampled radar data acquired by the driver and retrieved
 * through a struct of type \ref Frame_Info_t by calling
 * \ref ep_radar_base_get_frame_data depends on the radar sensor hardware.
 *
 * The radar front end comprises a mixer that demodulates the RF signal
 * received through the connected antennas down to the base band, where it is
 * captured by an Analog/Digital Converter (ADC). A RF mixer can output two
 * signals with a phase shift of 90?, called I-signal and Q-signal. These two
 * signals can be considered to be real and imaginary part of a complex valued
 * signal. Depending on the sensor hardware, the sensor may be able to capture
 * only one or both signals with its ADCs.
 *
 * If only one signal is captured, the radar frame data is real valued, so a
 * block of N samples consists of N values. If both signals are captured, a
 * block of N samples consists of 2*N values, which may be interleaved (each
 * real value is followed by the according imaginary value) or straight (N real
 * samples followed by N imaginary samples).
