/**
 * \file EndpointRadarADCXMC.h
 *
 * \brief This file defines the API to communicate with Radar ADC XMC
 *        Endpoints in Infineon sensor devices.
 *
 * The module EndpointRadarADCXMC.c provides functions to communicate with
 * Infineon radar sensor devices. The user must use the function provided by
 * the module \ref Protocol.c to open a connection to a radar sensor device
 * and query information about the endpoints in the device.
 *
 * The function \ref ep_radar_adcxmc_is_compatible_endpoint can be used to check
 * each endpoint if it is compatible with this API. If it is the types and
 * functions in from this module can be used to send parameters to the
 * endpoint and query the current settings and radar frame data.
 *
 * All data received from the connected device is returned through callbacks.
 * For each message type that can be received from the device, a separate
 * callback function type is defined. The user must register the callback
 * function for each message type. If no callback function is registered the
 * received message is ignored. Additionally the user can provide a data
 * context pointer for each callback function that will be forwarded with any
 * call to that function.
