 * \brief The function writes an unsigned 64 bit integer value to a payload
 *        buffer.
 *
 * The function writes the given value into the given payload buffer at the
 * requested position. If needed the byte order is swapped to convert from the
 * payload's little endian format to the CPU's endian format.
 *
 * \param[in] payload  A pointer to a block of payload data.
 * \param[in] offset   The byte position at which the value will be written
 *                     to.
 * \param[in] value    The value to be written into the payload buffer.
